# Changing
A Game Engine Named Changing

## Introduction
Out of interest in game engines, I came across [TheCherno](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCherno)'s [Game Engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxIZbV_XjAs&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT) tutorial on YouTube. Undoubtedly, it's a tutorial of exceptional quality that has been immensely helpful, providing me with a solid foundation in understanding game engines.

Currently, the code in this project is implemented step by step following [TheCherno](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCherno)'s [Game Engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxIZbV_XjAs&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT) tutorial. Perhaps in the future, as I delve further into my studies, I'll incorporate elements that are uniquely my own.

By the way, I've casually given a name to this engine â€“ I call it "Changing."
